# Robocup-2025


## What is Robocup?
[Robocup Junior Soccer Open](https://junior.robocup.org/soccer/) is a league of the international robotic competition: [RoboCup](https://robocup.org).
For this competition, we need to create _two fully autonomous robots_ that play _soccer_ against other teams. We have to design, build and program the robots without external help. This is a really challenging problem because the robots need to be fully autonomous. They need to detect the ball and try to go towards it to hopefully push it towards the goal. A camera system is needed to try to detect the ball based on its color (it's an orange golf ball) and to detect the opponent's goal.
